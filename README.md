remote-media
============

little c# webstack to simulate media key presses remotely


# How?

Run the application on a windows machine, and browse to `hostname:port` in a browser.

> You must run the app as admin!

> You must allow the port through your firewall! (default is `3000`)

> You must be sure served.html is in the directory you run the app from! 

# Why?

I was bored tonight, and wanted to be able to pull up a page on my phone to change the song on my desktop,
be it spotify or itunes that's playing.
