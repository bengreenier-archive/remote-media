remote-media
============

little c# webstack to simulate media key presses remotely


# How?

Run the application on a windows machine, and browse to `hostname:port` in a browser.

notes: __you must run the app as admin!__, and __you must allow the port through your firewall! (default is 3000)__

# Why?

I was bored tonight, and wanted to be able to pull up a page on my phone to change the song on my desktop,
be it spotify or itunes that's playing.
